This project aims to predict the number of adviews on Youtube based on various metrics such as likes, comments, and more. Advertisers pay content creators based on the number of adviews and clicks they receive, and this prediction model can help estimate the number of adviews.



## Technologies Used
This project was developed using the following technologies:

1. Jupyter Notebook

2. Python



## Files
1. `Youtube Adview Prediction ML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and analysis for the project.

2. `Youtube Adview Prediction ML.py`: Python file containing the code for the project.

3. `youtube.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.



## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `Youtube Adview Prediction ML.ipynb` or `Youtube Adview Prediction ML.py` file in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.
